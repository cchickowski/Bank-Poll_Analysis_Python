## Python Bank Analysis and Polling Data Analysis

In this repository, I analyzed two sets of data. First, I took the file budget_data.csv and created a Python script to analyze certain factors. 
The first piece of my script was designed to sum up the total months of data and the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period. 
Once calculating those items, my script calculated the average monthly profit/loss change over the entire period. Next, my script identifies the 
month with the greatest increase in profit over the entire period and the month with the greatest losses over the entire period. That calculation 
also give the amount of the great profit or loss during those months. Finally, when running my script it prints out the results of that analysis, and
outputs the results into a separate test file. My bank results output is below:

My second analysis took the file election_data.csv and created a Python script to analyze the results. First, this script attempted to calculated the
total amount of votes accumulated among all candidates. From there, the goal was to breakdown the voting results per candidate. To accomplish this, 
my script calculated the amount of votes per candidate, and the percentage of the total vote each candidates collected. Lastly, my script determined
the winner of the election based on their popular vote achieved. Finally, my script prints out the results of that analysis, and outputs the results
into a separate test file. My polling results output is below:
