## Python Bank Analysis and Polling Data Analysis

In this repository, I analyzed two sets of data. First, I took the file budgetdata.csv and created a Python script to analyze certain factors. 
The first piece of my script was designed to sum up the total months of data and the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period. 
Once calculating those items, my script calculated the average monthly profit/loss change over the entire period. Next, my script identifies the 
month with the greatest increase in profit over the entire period and the month with the greatest losses over the entire period. That calculation 
also give the amount of the great profit or loss during those months. Finally, when running my script it prints out the results of that analysis, and
outputs the results into a separate test file. My results output is below:
